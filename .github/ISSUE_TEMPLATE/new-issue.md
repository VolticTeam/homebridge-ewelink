<!-- PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING A NEW ISSUE
   * Please use this template as well as you can, in a lot of cases I will probably ask for things you might skip anyway.
   * This is not the place for issues with the homebridge-ewelink-max plugin. I am not the owner of homebridge-ewelink-max -->

### What issue do you have? Please be as thorough and explicit as possible.



### Details of your setup.
* Do you use Homebridge (with config-ui?) or HOOBS? 



* Which version of Homebridge/HOOBS do you have?



* Which version of this plugin (homebridge-ewelink) do you have? Has the issue started since upgrading from a previous version?



* Which eWeLink devices do you have that are causing issues? Please include product models if applicable.



* Do you use your main eWeLink credentials or do you use a secondary eWeLink account for Homebridge?



### Please paste any relevant logs below.
<!--
   It helps if you can turn on 'Debug Logging' and 'Request & Response Logging' in the plugin settings for more thorough logging.
   If you are posting an error then it is helpful for me to also see the previous few lines as this can show the cause of the error.
   Please enter the logs between the two ``` lines below so that the logs are formatted in a way which is easier to read
-->
