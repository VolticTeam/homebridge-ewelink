<!--
   PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING A NEW ISSUE
   * Please use this template as well as you can, in a lot of cases I will probably ask for things you might skip anyway.
   * Are you using a second eWeLink account for Homebridge? Please try using your main eWeLink account instead.
   * This is not the place for issues with the homebridge-ewelink-max plugin. I am not the owner of homebridge-ewelink-max
-->



**What issue do you have? Please be as thorough and explicit as possible.**
<!--
   Please also state any changes may be leading to this error, examples include:
   * Has this error started since updating this plugin? Which version were you using before when it worked?
   * Have you tried clearing the device from the Homebridge cache to see if this solves problems?
-->



**Details of your setup.**
* Do you use Homebridge (with config-ui?) or HOOBS? 



* Which version of Homebridge/HOOBS do you have?



* Which version of this plugin (homebridge-ewelink) do you have?



* Which eWeLink devices do you have that are causing issues?



**Please paste any relevant logs below.**
<!--
   It helps if you can turn on 'Debug Logging' and 'Request & Response Logging' in the package settings for more thorough logging.
   If you are posting an error then it is helpful for me to also see the previous few lines as this can show the cause of the error.
   Please enter the logs between the two ``` lines below so that the logs are formatted in a way which is easier to read
